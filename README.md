# Data Analysis and Business Strategy for Thrift Stores

Our objective is to perform a statistical analysis that will help a newly opened thrift store to make efficient and profitful businesses decisions. 

In this machine learning project, we will be able to predict which pieces of clothing in a Thrift Store are expensive (>= 100 reais) and which pieces of clothing are cheap (<100 reais), with 95 % accuracy, based only on the clothing descriptions. This allowed us to grasp which brands are the most valuable in the market, and to make sense of how much of this value is lost due to second-hand selling of these clothes.

***A personal history of how I came up with this project and how it was developed***: The idea of this project sparked once the COVID-19 pandemic hit and my mother-in-law, who owns a Thrift Store, had to close her shop due to the quarentine. As I was trying to find solutions to help her business, I stumped on that Thrift Store dataset on Kaggle, that up to then had no notebooks written on it. Factually, the dataset is hard to work with because that are only a small number of numerical variables, and because it is written in portuguese, so even NLP techniques are somewhat limiting.
