# Data Analysis and Business Strategy for Thrift Stores

Our objective is to perform a statistical analysis that will help a newly opened thrift store to make efficient and profitful businesses decisions. 

In this machine learning project, we will be able to predict which pieces of clothing in a Thrift Store are expensive (>= 100 reais) and which pieces of clothing are cheap (<100 reais), with 95 % accuracy, based only on the clothing descriptions.
