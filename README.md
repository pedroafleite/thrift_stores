# Business intelligence for Thrift Stores

In this machine learning project, we will be able to predict which pieces of clothing in a Thrift Store are expensive (>= 100 reais) and which of those are cheap (<100 reais), with 95 % accuracy, based only on the clothing descriptions.

 - See the complete data analysis [here](https://github.com/pedroafleite/thrift_stores/blob/master/thrift_store.ipynb).
 - Data source on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mateuspgomes/brazil-thrift-stores-data).
 - Files uploaded here (.csv) have already been partially cleaned; e.g. typos corrected.
 
Our objective is to perform a statistical analysis that will help a newly opened thrift store to make efficient and profitful businesses decisions. Data analysis will be done through the following steps:

1. Data cleaning
2. Data exploration
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

The notebooks are still midway through their development. NLP is still at its early stages and is not shown here.
