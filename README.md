Our objective here is to perform a statistical analysis that will help a newly opened thrift store to make efficient and profitful businesses decisions. Data analysis will be done through the following steps:

1. Data cleaning
2. Data exploration
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

The notebooks are still midway through their development.
NLP is still underway, at its early stages and are not shown here.
