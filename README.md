# thrift_stores

 - See the data analysis [here](https://github.com/pedroafleite/thrift_stores/blob/master/thrift_store.ipynb).
 - Data source on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mateuspgomes/brazil-thrift-stores-data).
 - Files uploaded here (.csv) have already been partially cleaned; e.g., typos corrected.
 
Our objective is to perform a statistical analysis that will help a newly opened thrift store to make efficient and profitful businesses decisions. Data analysis will be done through the following steps:

1. Data cleaning
2. Data exploration
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

The notebooks are still midway through their development. NLP is still at its early stages and is not shown here.
